### Chrome extension for stackoverflow

This chrome extension fixes an issue where the bottom scrollbar blocks the last line of stackoverflow pre text or blocks of code. Pretty annoying right?

I know what you are gonna say..

"But MacOs auto hides scrollbars by default 🙄"

Sometimes it doesn't work and it gets more annoying every time you encounter it.

### Here is how to set up, or not, I don't know what you want to do. It's not like I can read minds or anything like that, or can I. 👀

- Open chrome or switch to it if you had it Open
- Enter `chrome://extensions/` on a new tab or an old one.
- Click on `load unpacked` and look for this extension wherever you cloned it to. If you don't know where, you are wrapped helically around an inclined plane 🔩. Coz you have to clone it again or something.
